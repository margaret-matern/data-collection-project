# Data Outputs

This directory is populated by the pipeline scripts and serves as the central artifact repository:

- `filings/` — PDFs and `filings.jsonl` metadata generated by `fetch_filings.py`.
- `docs/` — Page-level and chunk-level JSONL outputs written by `index_filings.py`.
- `prompts/` — Prompt records produced by `generate_prompts.py`.
- `allocations/` — Labeler planning outputs created by `allocate_labelers.py`.

All JSONL files are UTF-8 encoded with one record per line.
